<div class="intro">
<p>
	The Color palette generator creates an arbitrarily large array of colors.
	The colors will be sorted so that one color is reasonably different to
	the next.  
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
	This is initially designed for use with Charts where you have
	more data series than built-in colours (Charts gives you 10) so that you
	can have different colored lines, reasonably different to each other, and
	so that consecutive data series have distinguishable colours.

<h3>Using Y.Color.generatePalette</h3>
<div>
	<p>
		To use generatePalette, include it in your use() statement
	</p>
	```
	YUI().use("gallery-color-palette", function (Y) {
		// Y.Color.generatePalette is now available
	});
	```
	<p>`generatePalette` accepts three arguments, all of which are optional:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>color</dt>
		<dd>A string giving the start color for the palette.  This will be the first
			color in the array that's returned.  The default value is #FF0000.
		</dd>
		<dt>count</dt>
		<dd>The number of colors you want to generate.</dd>
		<dt>options</dt>
		<dd>An object literal that gives you greater control over the colors generated
			by limited the range of hues, saturation and luminance used.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>To create 15 colors, starting from mid-blue:</p>
	```
	var myColors = Y.Color.generatePalette("#0095FF", 15);
	```
	<p>By default, the array will be ordered by hue.  For larger arrays of 
		colors, you may wish to mix these up: `Y.Color.mixupColors` will do
		this for you:</p>
	```
	var mixedColors = Y.Color.mixupColors(myColors);
	```
	<p>These will be the same colors, in a different order.</p>
</div>
